# Hi, I'm Christoph!

I'm a software engineering consultant living in London,<br />
helping companies improve their processes, practices and products.

You can find out more about myself and the work I do over on [the about page](/about/).
Recently I've released an [ebook about TDD](/book/) in TypeScript and React called <em>Build Your Own Spreadsheet</em>.
Check it out over at <a href="https://buildyourownspreadsheet.com" ref="external">buildyourownspreadsheet.com</a>.
I also publish more content around software development [as articles here](/articles/).

I wrote a book!
Well, an ebook that is.

It's about the application of test-driven development (TDD) for a non-trivial user-interface component.
Tools and languages used are TypeScript, React, Vitest, React Testing Library, HTML and CSS.

The target audience are fellow developers who are interested in learning more about test-driven development (TDD) in general or developers who know TDD already but are interested in learning more about tools and techniques to approach it with React.

The content is written as a text-based pairing session and each change is discussed and shown in a <tt>git-diff</tt> style.

At the end of it you'll have a fully working spreadsheet component!
It's available as a PDF file as well as ePub.
